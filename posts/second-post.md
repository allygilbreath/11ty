Echoes of a Forgotten World : Blog Post 2

I set foot on the planet’s surface, my boots pressing into fine, violet dust that has not been disturbed in millennia. The air is thin but breathable, laced with the metallic scent of ozone and decay. Ruins stretch before me—structures worn down by time, their purpose long forgotten. Someone lived here once. A civilization that rose, thrived, and vanished before humanity even knew how to shape fire. I run my gloved fingers along the etched remains of their language, indecipherable yet hauntingly familiar.

As I explore, I find something unexpected—an artifact, humming softly with latent energy. It reacts to my presence, pulsing like a heartbeat. For the first time in years, I feel something stir within me. Hope? Fear? I do not know. What I do know is that I am no longer just an observer of the universe. I am a witness to its forgotten past, a lone human standing in the remnants of something greater. And perhaps, if I listen closely enough, I will hear the echoes of those who came before.
