The Silence Between Stars : Blog Post 1 

Drifting through the void, I have learned that space is not just empty—it is heavy. Heavy with the weight of silence, the absence of voices, the quiet hum of my ship’s life support system struggling to convince me I am not alone. It has been 347 days since I last saw another living being, though I can’t be sure anymore if that number means anything. Time, out here, is fluid. I measure my days not in sunrises, but in system diagnostics and ration inventories.

The stars outside my viewport are ancient, distant memories of light that left their sources long before I was born. Sometimes, I wonder if I will become just as distant—a signal lost in the cosmic noise, a forgotten explorer whose transmissions will never reach home. But then, a planet appears on my long-range scanners, its surface reflecting the pale glow of a dying sun. Maybe, just maybe, I will find something there. Maybe I will find proof that I am not the only one left.
