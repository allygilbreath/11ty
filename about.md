# About the Explorer  
<img class="about" alt="Planet" src="/images/planet.png" width="200" />

I am the last known human to leave Earth, bound for the outer reaches of the galaxy.  
My mission is to document the unknown and report my findingsâ€”if there's anyone left to receive them.  

The silence of deep space is both my sanctuary and my prison. Every day, I search for signs of life, hoping to prove that I am not truly alone.  

This log serves as my record, my testament, and my connection to whatever may still exist beyond the void.
